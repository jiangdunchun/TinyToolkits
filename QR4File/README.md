# INTRODUCTION

> The 'file_qr_encoder.py' can generate qr_codes from files' contents with compress and the 'file_qr_decoder.py' can reconstruct the files from these qr codes. The qr codes' name can be changed arbitrarily before decoding them, but misssing any of them is unacceptable. 

> The 'file_qr_gen.py' can generate qr_codes from single file' content.

# How TO RUN

> run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in terminal (the python version in my mechine is 3.9)
